# Task: Automate ESP32 Dev Task

## Objective
Develop a script or tool to automate a specific development, testing, or deployment task within the ESP32 workflow.

## Input
*   **Target Task:** Description of the manual ESP32 development task to be automated (e.g., flashing multiple devices, running a sequence of tests, parsing serial output).
*   **Tools/Languages:** Preferred automation language (e.g., Python, Bash) and relevant ESP32 tools (e.g., `esptool.py`, `idf.py`, PlatformIO CLI).

## Workflow

1.  **Understand Task:**
    *   Break down the manual task into atomic steps.
    *   Identify inputs, outputs, and decision points.
2.  **Tool/API Identification:**
    *   Research available command-line tools or Python APIs (if using Python) that can perform the identified steps programmatically.
    *   Example: `esptool.py` for flashing, `idf.py monitor` for serial output, PySerial for custom serial interactions.
3.  **Script/Tool Development:**
    *   Write the automation script or simple application.
    *   Implement necessary error handling and logging.
    *   Ensure cross-platform compatibility if required.
4.  **Testing:**
    *   Test the automation script/tool with realistic or simulated ESP32 scenarios.
    *   Verify that it correctly performs the desired task and handles edge cases gracefully.

## Output
Markdown document containing:
*   The automation script/tool code, ideally in a language block.
*   Instructions on how to use, configure, and run the script/tool.
*   Description of the problem solved and benefits gained.
